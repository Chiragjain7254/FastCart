# FastCart

FastCart is a comprehensive Supermarket Management System implemented in C++. It provides a user-friendly interface for both administrators and buyers to efficiently manage and interact with the supermarket. Administrators can seamlessly add, modify, or remove products from the inventory, while buyers can conveniently purchase products and generate receipts.

## Features

- **Administrator Functions:**
  - Add new products to the inventory with details such as product code, name, price, and discount.
  - Modify existing product details including price, name, and discount.
  - Remove products from the inventory.

- **Buyer Functions:**
  - Browse available products and make purchases.
  - Generate receipts for the purchased items.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/FastCart.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd FastCart
   ```

3. Compile the source code:
